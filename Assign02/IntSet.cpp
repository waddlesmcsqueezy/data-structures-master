// FILE: IntSet.cpp - header file for IntSet class
//       Implementation file for the IntStore class
//       (See IntSet.h for documentation.)
// INVARIANT for the IntSet class:
// (1) Distinct int values of the IntSet are stored in a 1-D,
//     dynamic array whose size is stored in member variable
//     capacity; the member variable data references the array.
// (2) The distinct int value with earliest membership is stored
//     in data[0], the distinct int value with the 2nd-earliest
//     membership is stored in data[1], and so on.
//     Note: No "prior membership" information is tracked; i.e.,
//           if an int value that was previously a member (but its
//           earlier membership ended due to removal) becomes a
//           member again, the timing of its membership (relative
//           to other existing members) is the same as if that int
//           value was never a member before.
//     Note: Re-introduction of an int value that is already an
//           existing member (such as through the add operation)
//           has no effect on the "membership timing" of that int
//           value.
// (4) The # of distinct int values the IntSet currently contains
//     is stored in the member variable used.
// (5) Except when the IntSet is empty (used == 0), ALL elements
//     of data from data[0] until data[used - 1] contain relevant
//     distinct int values; i.e., all relevant distinct int values
//     appear together (no "holes" among them) starting from the
//     beginning of the data array.
// (6) We DON'T care what is stored in any of the array elements
//     from data[used] through data[capacity - 1].
//     Note: This applies also when the IntSet is empry (used == 0)
//           in which case we DON'T care what is stored in any of
//           the data array elements.
//     Note: A distinct int value in the IntSet can be any of the
//           values an int can represent (from the most negative
//           through 0 to the most positive), so there is no
//           particular int value that can be used to indicate an
//           irrelevant value. But there's no need for such an
//           "indicator value" since all relevant distinct int
//           values appear together starting from the beginning of
//           the data array and used (if properly initialized and
//           maintained) should tell which elements of the data
//           array are actually relevant.
//
// DOCUMENTATION for private member (helper) function:
//   void resize(int new_capacity)
//     Pre:  (none)
//           Note: Recall that one of the things a constructor
//                 has to do is to make sure that the object
//                 created BEGINS to be consistent with the
//                 class invariant. Thus, resize() should not
//                 be used within constructors unless it is at
//                 a point where the class invariant has already
//                 been made to hold true.
//     Post: The capacity (size of the dynamic array) of the
//           invoking IntSet is changed to new_capacity...
//           ...EXCEPT when new_capacity would not allow the
//           invoking IntSet to preserve current contents (i.e.,
//           value for new_capacity is invalid or too low for the
//           IntSet to represent the existing collection),...
//           ...IN WHICH CASE the capacity of the invoking IntSet
//           is set to "the minimum that is needed" (which is the
//           same as "exactly what is needed") to preserve current
//           contents...
//           ...BUT if "exactly what is needed" is 0 (i.e. existing
//           collection is empty) then the capacity should be
//           further adjusted to 1 or DEFAULT_CAPACITY (since we
//           don't want to request dynamic arrays of size 0).
//           The collection represented by the invoking IntSet
//           remains unchanged.
//           If reallocation of dynamic array is unsuccessful, an
//           error message to the effect is displayed and the
//           program unconditionally terminated.
